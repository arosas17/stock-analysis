# Stock-Analysis

## Overview

A couple want to invest into green energy companies, believing that as more resources are used, green energy will become more in demand. In doing this, this couple has invested in a single company called DAQO New Energy Corp(DQ) without doing any research. Their is concern about diversifying their stocks and was given a list of stacks in order to look at. A VBA Macro was created so that the stocks may be organized and clearer to read so better investments may be made. However, we wanted to make to refactor the Macro to run better so that if the stock list was expanded, it would take less time to obtain the results. 



## Results

: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.





## Summary

In a summary statement, address the following questions.
What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?

There are a few advantages in refactoring code such as, to make the code more organized and fluid. Refactoring code will give opportunity to make things easier to read. There is also some benefits in getting the code to run better. If the refactored and original Macros are compared, it is noticed that the refactored code has a faster run time than the original. It makes close no difference in time with the list at the moment, but if the list was ballooned to size that dwarfs its predecessor, the difference in time could be noticeable.

As much as these benefits from refactored code would help; refactoring does come with some costs. Errors may occur when refactoring a Macro which could make it time consuming. In this refactor, even though the edits were simple individually, many errors occurred when it was being performed making it somewhat a time consuming project. This can be accredited to the idea that working with a new code  (even a code you a somewhat familiar with) can be a difficult task and should obtain good understanding of the code when refactoring. A person would also have to take into account if the Macro would be utilized enough to be worth refactoring.
